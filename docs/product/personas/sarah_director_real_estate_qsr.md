- sarah_realestate_director_QSR

## Background
- Age: 38
- Role: Director of Real Estate for a 600-location fast-casual/QSR chain
- History: Started as a commercial broker, moved in-house to lead site selection, relocations, and lease renewals
- Team: Small team of real estate managers and analysts; partners closely with Finance and Operations

## How She’s Measured
- New store performance vs pro forma in year 1–2 (traffic and revenue)
- Portfolio productivity (average sales per store, closures vs openings)
- Hit rate of “good boxes” vs underperforming locations
- Speed and quality of deal flow (qualified sites approved per quarter)

## Core Motivations
- Avoid a string of bad calls that damage her credibility and P&L
- Show that real estate decisions are a growth lever, not just a cost center
- Win internal debates with Finance/Ops using hard data, not anecdotes
- Build a repeatable, defensible playbook for expansion and infill

## How She Uses Placer.ai
- Evaluate candidate sites vs top-quartile comps on traffic, trade area, and visitor profile
- Quantify cannibalization risk and white space for infill markets
- Monitor new store ramp-up vs expectations (weekly/monthly)
- Benchmark centers/markets to decide where to double down vs exit

## Sample Queries

1. Site selection vs comps  
> Compare weekly and monthly visit trends, trade areas, and visitor demographics for this proposed location at [address] against our top 10 performing stores in the same metro and similar center types. Highlight any material differences in traffic volume, draw radius, and income bands.

Expected output:  
A comparison table and charts showing visits over time, trade area maps, and demographic breakdowns for the candidate site vs selected comps, plus a short summary of key risks/opportunities.

2. Cannibalization risk  
> For our existing stores at [Store A address] and [Store B address], estimate the cannibalization impact if we open a new store at [candidate address]. Show overlap in trade areas, projected shift in visits, and any incremental traffic we’d unlock.

Expected output:  
Overlapping trade area visualizations, estimates of overlapping visitors, and a scenario-based projection of visit redistribution and incremental visits, with a concise narrative on likely cannibalization.

3. Portfolio ranking in a market  
> In the [metro name] market, rank all of our current store locations by 12-month visit trends, visit frequency, and dwell time. Flag stores with sustained negative trend vs market benchmarks and suggest clusters where we should look for relocation or closure candidates.

Expected output:  
Ranked list of stores with key metrics, trend charts, a simple “green/yellow/red” risk classification, and identification of at-risk locations and high-potential submarkets.
