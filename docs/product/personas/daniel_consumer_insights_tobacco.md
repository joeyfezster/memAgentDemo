## Background
- Age: 42
- Role: Director of Consumer Insights & Activation for a major tobacco company
- History: Previously led consumer insights in beer/spirits; experienced with segmentation, path-to-purchase, and trade activation
- Scope: Owns where/when/how to launch new products, and how to align launches with channels and moments

## How He’s Measured
- New product launch performance: trial, repeat, and share in target segments within 6–12 months
- Channel and outlet strategy quality: velocity per point of distribution, not just distribution breadth
- ROI on shopper and trade marketing programs
- Accuracy of his “market map” and recommendations to senior leadership

## Core Motivations
- De-risk launches with concrete behavioral data rather than generic survey panels
- Find real-world micro-moments when high-value consumers are most receptive
- Demonstrate that precise geo + outlet strategy beats blanket promotions
- Build a track record of picking the right locations and channels for launches

## How He Uses Placer.ai (Golf-Focused Product Launch)
- Identify golf courses and practice facilities in target metro areas and analyze visitor volumes and profiles
- Map “before and after” visits to see where golfers stop on the way to and from the course
- Rank convenience stores, pro shops, bars, and other outlets by overlap with golf course visitors
- Inform a staged product placement and activation plan around courses and high-index outlets
- Monitor post-launch changes in traffic patterns at prioritized outlets

## Sample Queries

1. Golf path-to-purchase mapping  
> For the [Metro Name] area, identify the top 20 golf courses by visit volume over the last 12 months, then map where their visitors most frequently go immediately before and after a course visit. Break the results down by venue type (convenience stores, gas stations, bars, grocery, etc.).

Expected output:  
List and charts of top golf courses, plus path analysis showing the most common pre- and post-visit venues with visit counts and percentages, segmented by venue category.

2. Priority outlet ranking around courses  
> For the top 5 golf courses in [Metro Name], rank nearby convenience stores, gas stations, and bars within a [X]-minute drive based on overlap with golf course visitors and visit frequency. Provide a recommended top 50 outlets for first-wave product placement.

Expected output:  
Ranked outlet list with overlap metrics (share of visitors who also visit each outlet), visit frequency, distance from courses, and a concise recommended first-wave outlet set.

3. Post-launch monitoring framework  
> Design a monitoring view to track whether our prioritized outlets near golf courses in [Metro Name] are capturing an increasing share of golf course visitors over the next 3–6 months. Show how you would baseline current patterns and then flag material positive or negative shifts.

Expected output:  
Definition of baseline metrics, sample dashboard structure (tables and charts), and logic for alerts/flags when share of golf-course visitors at targeted outlets moves up or down beyond defined thresholds.
