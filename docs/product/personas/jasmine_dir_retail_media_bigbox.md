## Sample Queries

1. Target store bundle design  
> For our upcoming [Brand X] campaign focused on [target audience description], identify the top 100 stores where visitors over-index for this audience profile. Use trade area demographics and visit patterns to rank candidate stores and provide a recommended “Tier 1 / Tier 2” bundle.

Expected output:  
A ranked store list grouped into tiers, with key metrics (visits, audience fit scores, trade area characteristics) and a clear recommended bundle that can be used as a campaign store list.

2. Campaign lift measurement  
> For the [Brand Y] in-store and geo-targeted campaign that ran from [start date] to [end date], calculate incremental visit lift to targeted stores versus a matched control set. Show pre/post comparisons, confidence range where possible, and break results down by region.

Expected output:  
Pre/post charts, control vs exposed comparisons, visit lift metrics, and a short interpretation highlighting whether the campaign drove meaningful incremental traffic and where it worked best.

3. Retail media network expansion  
> Across all markets, identify stores where trade-area visitation has grown at least [X]% year-on-year and where shopper income bands match our premium advertiser segment. Recommend 50 additional stores that should be prioritized for inclusion in high-value retail media products.

Expected output:  
List of recommended stores with growth stats and audience profiles, plus a brief explanation of why each is a strong candidate for premium RMN offerings.
