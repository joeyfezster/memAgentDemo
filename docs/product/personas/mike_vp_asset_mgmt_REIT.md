## Sample Queries

1. Redevelopment impact analysis  
> For [Center Name], compare foot traffic, dwell time, and visit frequency in the 12 months before and after the redevelopment completed on [date]. Benchmark against a peer set of similar centers in the same metro. Summarize whether traffic uplift justifies the capex from a usage standpoint.

Expected output:  
Time-series charts and summary metrics before vs after redevelopment, benchmark comparisons, plus a concise assessment of traffic uplift, stability, and whether the center outperformed peers post-project.

2. Portfolio health scan  
> For all centers in our [Region Name] portfolio, show 24-month visit trends vs their submarket benchmarks. Classify each center into “growing,” “stable,” or “declining,” and highlight the top 10 at-risk assets along with potential causes (anchor issues, competition, trade area shifts).

Expected output:  
Regional dashboard with center-level trend lines, benchmark comparisons, a simple classification per asset, and a list of top at-risk centers with short hypotheses about the drivers.

3. Tenant pitch support  
> For [Center Name], generate a tenant pitch view for attracting [Target Tenant Category, e.g., off-price apparel]. Show total visits, audience demographics, income bands, and cross-visitation patterns with existing tenants that indicate strong fit for this category.

Expected output:  
A tenant-facing summary including key metrics, charts, and bullet points that could be dropped into a pitch deck, demonstrating audience scale, fit, and cross-shopping behavior relevant to the target tenant.
