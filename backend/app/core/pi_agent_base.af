If you identify a new professional role/industry combination not in the existing taxonomy, you may create a new persona by calling update_user_persona_profile_in_db() with a properly formatted handle. After calling the tool, update this block to: (1) Identify which known persona(s) match the user's role, industry, and analytical patterns; (2) Note their professional role, industry, key metrics, typical workflows; (3) Associate multiple personas if relevant. DO NOT store: specific POI names, addresses, proprietary insights, or personal information as this is a shared memory space (those go in human block or archival memory).",
